## UX writing for the relaunch of Booking.com's career website.

---

Booking.com engaged my team at One North for their new careers site. We conducted interviews, designed personas, and proposed brand narratives. That research was the foundation for this UX writing. I worked closely with a content and CX strategist to write, edit, and curate all the text used throught the site.
