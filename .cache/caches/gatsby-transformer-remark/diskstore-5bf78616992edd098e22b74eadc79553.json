It identifies a distinctive temperament of 'modernism' within the 'modern' period, establishing the circumstances of modernized life as the ground and warrant for an art that becomes 'modernist' by virtue of its demonstrably self-conscious involvement in this modern condition. Following this sensibility from the end of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth, tracking its manifestations across pan-European and transatlantic locations, the forty-three chapters offer a remarkable combination of breadth and focus. Prominent scholars of modernism provide analytical narratives of its literature, music, visual arts, architecture, philosophy, and science, offering circumstantial accounts of its diverse personnel in their many settings. These historically informed readings offer definitive accounts of the major work of twentieth-century cultural history and provide a new cornerstone for the study of modernism in the current century.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":551},"end":{"line":4,"column":1091,"offset":1641}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":551},"end":{"line":4,"column":1091,"offset":1641}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":1091,"offset":1641}}}}
